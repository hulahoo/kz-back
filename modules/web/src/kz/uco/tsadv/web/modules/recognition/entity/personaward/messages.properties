award.rules=Remember the complex "Nomination" form on the Intranet? We made it easier. There are only two fields now: "Story" and "Why should an employee be nominated?". The field "Story" is filled in the same way as the field "Your comment" in the "Thank" form. However, the "Thank" and "Nomination" forms are not the same. Please, keep in mind that situations, where you would like to thank someone could be happening often, whereas the HEART Awards are given as a reward for the whole year’s achievements. It is the coolest reward in our company and it should be given only to the best of us. Please describe the qualities that this employee showed in the field "Why should an employee be nominated?" and provide examples of these qualities’ manifestations. Simply writing "proactive and works well within a team" is not sufficient for a nomination. Therefore, the forms with such content will not be taken for consideration. Please be more studious. Furthermore, now you can save the form as a draft and continue later. <br/><br/>Find out more about HEART Awards, using the link below: <a href="http://intranet.airastana.com/People-Portal/HEART-Awards/Nomination.aspx?lang=en-US" target="_blank">http://intranet.airastana.com/People-Portal/HEART-Awards/Nomination.aspx?lang=en-US</a>
